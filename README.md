## Prerequisites

Make sure the following requirements are installed:

### Homebrew

Install Homebrew, if you haven't: https://brew.sh.

Then use Homebrew to install some necessary packages:

```bash
$ ./brew.sh
```

### RVM

RVM is a command-line tool which allows you to easily install, manage, and work with multiple ruby environments from interpreters to sets of gems. Install RVM: https://rvm.io.

### NVM

Node Version Manager - Simple bash script to manage multiple active node.js versions. To install nvm: https://github.com/creationix/nvm.

### Oh My Zsh

[Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) is a ZSH framework, I will soon replace it with [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto).


## Installation

Clone this project (suppose you are at `$HOME`):

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:huyvohcmc/dotfiles.git
```

Create a backup for existing dotfiles at `~/dotfiles.backup` and install the new ones:

```bash
$ cd dotfiles && ./bootstrap.sh
```

The bootstrap script support 3 arguments:

- `--install | -i` to symlink the dotfiles in this repo
- `--update | -u` to fetch the latest dotfiles from remote
- `--backup | -b` to backup the dotfiles and save to `~/.dotfiles.backup`

## Neovim

Install `vim-plug`, a minimalist Vim plugin manager: https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug.

Then open `nvim` and install all plugins: `PlugInstall`. You should also run `:checkhealth` to check your `nvim` condition.

What's inside `init.vim`?

- [tender](https://github.com/jacoborus/tender.vim) - A 24bit colorscheme for Vim, Airline and Lightline
- [lightline](https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim) - A light and configurable statusline/tabline plugin for Vim
- [NERDTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) - A tree explorer plugin for Vim
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim) - A command-line fuzzy finder for Vim
- [ALE](https://github.com/w0rp/ale) - Asynchronous Lint Engine
- [Polyglot](https://github.com/sheerun/vim-polyglot) - A solid language pack for Vim
- [ncm2](https://github.com/ncm2/ncm2) - Completion framework for Neovim
- [Gutentags](https://github.com/ludovicchabant/vim-gutentags) - A Vim plugin that manages your tag files
- [Easymotion](https://github.com/easymotion/vim-easymotion) - Vim motions on speed!
- [Sandwich](https://github.com/machakann/vim-sandwich) - A plugin to add/delete/replace surroundings of text
- [Signify](https://github.com/mhinz/vim-signify) - Show a diff using Vim its sign column
- [Tcomment](https://github.com/tomtom/tcomment_vim) - Comment vim-plugin
- [Fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) - A Git wrapper vim-plugin
- [rhubarb](https://github.com/tpope/vim-rhubarb) - GitHub extension for fugitive.vim
- [Rails](https://github.com/tpope/vim-rails) - Ruby on Rails power tools

Note: you should install [rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) and [eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) so `ALE` can work properly:

```bash
$ gem install rubocop
$ npm install -g eslint
```

## ZSH

Install [purer](https://github.com/DFurnes/purer), a ZSH prompt based on [pure](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure):

```bash
$ npm install --global purer-prompt
```

`zshrc` is already set `purer` as the default prompt.

Next, install [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) and [zsh-history-substring-search](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search).

Just like `purer`, these plugins are already set in `zshrc` so you don't need to do anthing else.

## Git

To prevent people from accidentally committing under your name:

```bash
# gitconfig
[user]
  # set in ~/.gitconfig_local
[include]
  path = ~/.gitconfig_local
```

Where `~/.gitconfig_local` is simply:

```bash
[user]
  name = Huy Vo
  email = huyvohcmc@gmail.com
```

I also use a `.gitmessage` template for co-authored commits on GitHub:

```bash
# ~/.gitmessage
Co-authored-by: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@transmeta.com>
```

## Iosevka

Install the fonts in `fonts/iosevka`:

```bash
$ cd fonts && ./install.sh
```

[Iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka) is one of the best font for programmers, it looks so good to the eye and supports ligatures. It also has many prebuilt variants, and if you build yourself you can customize the look of many different characters. Here is how I built an Iosevka version for my own:

1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure `nodejs` >= 8.4, `ttfautohint` and `otfcc` are installed
3. Install necessary libs by `npm install`
4. `npm run build -- contents:iosevka-term`

Visit Iosevka's main repo for more build instructions.

## Will... will this work on Windows?
